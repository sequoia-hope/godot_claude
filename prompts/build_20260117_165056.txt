Test Room - MVP Milestone

Create a rectangular room for testing the AI-driven game development pipeline.

ENVIRONMENT:
- Rectangular room approximately 10 meters wide x 15 meters long x 4 meters tall
- Walls, floor, and ceiling with simple grid placeholder texture (1-meter grid pattern)
- Grid should be black lines on white/light gray background for easy visibility
- Room should be fully enclosed (no gaps in walls)

PLAYER:
- CharacterBody3D-based player controller
- Starts in the center of the room
- First-person perspective
- Camera attached as child node of player

MOVEMENT:
- WASD for movement (forward, backward, left strafe, right strafe)
- Space bar for jump
- Mouse movement for camera look/turn
- Walking speed: 5 m/s
- Jump height: 2 meters
- Gravity should feel natural

LIGHTING:
- Single DirectionalLight3D positioned above and slightly to the side
- Basic ambient lighting to ensure entire room is visible
- No shadows required (keep performance simple)

CAMERA:
- Positioned at player head height (approximately 1.7 meters)
- Follows player movement smoothly
- Mouse sensitivity should allow full 360-degree rotation

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Include TestRunner autoload for automated testing
- Implement input actions: move_forward, move_backward, move_left, move_right, jump
- Enable screenshot capture capability
- Include FPS counter and performance monitoring
- Target 60 FPS minimum
- Keep scene simple - no complex assets or effects

VISUAL STYLE:
- Clean, minimal aesthetic
- Grid textures should be crisp and visible
- No fancy materials - use StandardMaterial3D with albedo texture
- Ensure good contrast between grid lines and background

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Player can walk to all four corners of the room
- Jump mechanics work correctly (player lands safely)
- Camera responds to mouse input smoothly
- Grid texture is visible on all surfaces
- No visual artifacts or z-fighting
- Maintains 60 FPS throughout testing
- No crashes or errors during automated test sequence
